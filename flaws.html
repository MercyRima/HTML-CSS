			<h4>CHARACTER FLAWS</h4>

		<p>
		Do you abandon your friends, or yourself, or is it much the same thing? For when you find yourself, your true self, you will find them also. You will see all of their actions, the ones you felt as crimes, for what they really were - the confusion of lost souls, ones who haven't seen a guiding light for some time.
		<br></br>
		So, trust me when I say this to you, "Walk this way, toward this childish spirit who sees with the heart and loves as birdsong in a summer breeze. Reach for the child-self you were born as, reconnect with innocence, and humble joy. Relearn the sweetness of giving as freely as sunshine and rain. Grow enough courage to step into the soft grass and flowers, so that one day you can see yourself as I do, so you can have inner peace and dream in true liberty.
		You say I abandoned you, became a ghost instead of a person of flesh and blood. I'm sorry you feel that way, truly. I felt for so long that my emotions and passions didn't matter to you, that your eyes never rested where I really was, maybe on the wall behind me or on my silhouette, never taking in what was right in front of you. I guess, looking back, you were in your own pain, lost in your own thoughts, a personal battle you assumed included me. It never did. And as I walked away your thoughts raged on without me, angry at a perception of me that was never me... anger at the ghost you made, the one you have a relationshi with... while I become a stranger.
