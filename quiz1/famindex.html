		<h1>THE BEST I EVER HAD. </h1>
			<h2>GOOD AND BAD IN ONE BUCKET</h2>
			<img src="img/2.gif">
				<p>My family was very large, and my parents’ appetite for procreation outstripped their small, hard to get budget.Every time there was a new member in the family the daily bread decreased with a bigger percentage than the previous one. By the time I was a teen, my appetite had grown but I was getting the same portions as the toddlers. Supper and lunch had no difference, same amount and never enough of either. It’s true that we as the elders learn more survival tactics of self-sustaining than our younger pampered peers. But we wanted our freedom as much. As soon as I started earning I was buying myself food and my siblings too.
				<br></br>
				I would welcome them in my bedroom and we could have a sibling’s only party, Away from our parents. After the feast our moods would be better and we didn’t mind catching up with each other. And giving stories about the village boys and girls of our age. Our mother was mostly snippy and short tempered and always overworked herself .Dad was ever stressed for being broke because of unnecessary expenses.
				<br></br>
				His parents were broke and drunkards just like him, so dad suffered mostly mentally for over thing about his background and his parent more than his kids. He frequently complained of not being taken to school and not brought up well. Mom grew up in various foster homes until she was adopted on her teenage age. Mom and her peers messed up pretty good because they didn’t have a role model.
				<br></br>
				For us we had our mom to look up to as our role model for advice and what’s not. And for my sibs, they have me.lucky enough we even have mentors outside home. But despite the struggles, the ups and downs in the family we still managed to grow with nothing but love for one another. I could hate anyone who tried to separate us or say anything crappy us .I could turn my back on them and keep walking. I guess if my parents would have put in more efforts in their work not blaming their parents or where they came from, Mostly my Dad, we would be a normal family with no special needs, whatever that is.
