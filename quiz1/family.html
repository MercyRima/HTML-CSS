			<h1>MY FAMILY</h1>
			<h4>GOOD AND BAD IN ONE BUCKET</h4>

		<p>
		My family was as dysfunctional as it was large. My parentsâ€™ enthusiasm for procreation vastly outstripped their scanty budget. With each new sibling the resource pie got cut a little finer. By the time I was a teen, fast growing and hungry, I got the same meat portion as the toddlers. The rest of my plate was potatoes and peas - and never enough of either.
		 It's true that we older kids learned more self-sufficiency and parenting skills than our more pampered peers, but for the most part we really just wanted our freedom. As soon as I could earn a buck I was buying my own food and some for my sibs too.</p>


		 <p> I'd usher them up to a bedroom and we'd have a "big-kids only feast" away from the little ones. Afterwards our moods were better and we didn't mind reading bed-time stories so much or even helping to fold the stacks of laundry. Mostly Mom was just snippy, short tempered and constantly over-worked. 
		 Dad was stressed from being flat broke in a never ending sea of necessary expenses... He was more mentally scarred than physically and his skin was a mass of old wounds. His parents were drunks for most of his childhood, then suddenly turned ultra-religious; eager not to spoil the child by sparing the rod. Mother grew up in various foster homes until she was finally adopted as a teenager.
		 I once asked her about her childhood and she had this look about her like a five year old watching "Nightmare movies." Between them they messed up pretty good, not having a good role model between them; well, apart from Aunt Carol, the one who adopted Mom.
		 They treated us like little adults from way too young, telling us the worries they had, telling us way too much information about how the world really works. Then when we were teens they swung the other way, trying to rein us in like we were toddlers. I could hate them both for all the crappy things they've said and done. 
		 I could turn my back on them and just keep walking. But for all their faults they loved us, they just hadn't a clue how to be parents. I guess if each generation messes up a bit less than the last one day we'll be a normal family, whatever that is.</p>
